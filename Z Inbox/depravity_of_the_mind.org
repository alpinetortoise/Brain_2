Though people often hold to [[id:e192a4e0-a063-4306-b15d-f0260b1eac34][Total Depravity]] due to their view of [[id:29ba0f2a-eb86-4d35-9fd4-451917e6c064][Western Exceptionalism]] in practicality they do not hold to the depravity of the mind, and so will elevate their [[id:0623dc01-9888-426f-a545-7b2b2ecddcc0][rationalism]]. Or maybe another way to look at it they divorce their [[id:0623dc01-9888-426f-a545-7b2b2ecddcc0][rationalism]] and [[id:b29e4045-6a6b-48ef-b4cc-a6fdcc18c03d][emotion]] and treat their emotions as if they're the part of the [[id:fc8180c2-3898-4699-bd70-4c08be06de7b][mind]] which is depraved, and not their [[id:0623dc01-9888-426f-a545-7b2b2ecddcc0][rationalism]]
