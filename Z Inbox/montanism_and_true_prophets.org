[[id:f213eea0-0373-4daf-9741-10470aec32a6][Tabernee, 2009]], sets a discussion between [[id:8c193ab8-83a1-4811-b024-1bd83738ecfc][Origen]] and Firmilian about how to tell an adherent of the [[id:ce2bfc66-f7e2-4cac-9269-4f0edb25f802][New Prophecy]] and a True Prophet apart, such a discussion, if held truly, would call into question the [[id:7e00eed4-9cb6-4dc6-9764-c1c8d253bbf9][Cessationist]] claim that prophecy had ceased by this time in the church and that [[id:c16c83af-86b4-4349-9989-c8e7efab3b10][it is known]] that this is true.
