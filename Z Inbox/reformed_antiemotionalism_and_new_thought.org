[[id:45edd769-f914-4def-8c02-0b2c76b153a5][New-Thought]]'s schematic for [[id:8a840ac7-5ee6-483a-bd77-ac21be95fcb6][anthropology]] seems awfully close to that of the [[id:5f81bf60-3a42-4af1-9218-d4ef10c0985c][Reformed Movement]] I would say in some ways the schematic diverges in the Reformed hallowing of the [[id:fc8180c2-3898-4699-bd70-4c08be06de7b][mind]], which in some respects goes against the belief that all humans are [[id:e192a4e0-a063-4306-b15d-f0260b1eac34][totally depraved]].
