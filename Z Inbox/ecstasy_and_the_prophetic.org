[[id:f213eea0-0373-4daf-9741-10470aec32a6][Tabernee, 2009]] notes a disagreement between Catholics and the [[id:ce2bfc66-f7e2-4cac-9269-4f0edb25f802][New Prophetics]] on whether or not Ecstasy is to be an authenticating mark of prophecy.

Interestingly both [[id:5f8fe3c1-a0a2-49ca-957a-e012646c0080][Modern Charismatics]] and [[id:7e00eed4-9cb6-4dc6-9764-c1c8d253bbf9][Cessationists]] to an extent are on the ecstatic side of this debate, there is a sense in which the [[id:6334f7d3-d93e-4d54-8602-3b46942793d9][Charismata]] are viewed as super/hyper-natural in the sense that they don't meet the mundaneity or ordinarity of Christian experience.

Also of note, [[id:18d3fa77-37cf-4c54-9974-ad522b36a67c][Tertullian]] in his [[id:6d279710-f033-4f14-8bd2-e26a8b607f0b][Adv. Marc.]] takes the [[id:ce2bfc66-f7e2-4cac-9269-4f0edb25f802][New Prophetic]] position, as he has already started his conversion towards this position.
