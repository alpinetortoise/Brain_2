There is a great deal of idealisation of the past, whether that is in [[id:948869d8-d3bb-4c3e-9aff-43e5a8d4c52c][Christian Primitivism]], [[id:ec04dfcc-63e3-43e4-b0a7-f8728df2267c][Nationalism]], or [[id:7e480957-d45a-4fd6-a2d1-4f32283c2a10][Marxism]].

[[id:f5708270-3674-4fb0-912a-ba69dd6c7294][Popper, Karl]] discusses this in [[id:91a7fcd1-2097-45f5-9a49-ca397cf15b1d][The Open Society and Its Enemies]], tracing the thought back to [[id:484ebb05-aa21-43da-af56-58bfd7a067f3][Plato]] and [[id:1dbcd238-681d-4131-942c-852b927f2475][Platonic forms]]

In some ways the [[id:f51da4ed-f059-4b4a-a5c0-fe1e908d3128][Hero's Journey]] stands against this idealism, the hero goes out not because the [[id:42650ac0-ea2e-4167-8808-8cfe0842e4e5][society]] from which he comes has [[id:e7d61b16-433c-41c5-b329-f06733b43b48][deteriorated]] and requires [[id:8dd7fd62-9696-4831-b8da-97f568644e72][reformation]] but he is called out, or sent out precisely because he in himself requires that [[id:2d237182-2da1-4dd1-800a-047116860794][reformation of self]] that can only come from [[id:4034661b-a621-4bf4-a7bf-fbd5e36e5ff1][self discovery]], indeed the only reason that the [[id:5c1fdb86-08d8-408f-86d5-db2e4f31f573][fire from the Gods]] can be of benefit to the [[id:42650ac0-ea2e-4167-8808-8cfe0842e4e5][society]] from which he came is because others also need such [[id:662101bd-d5e3-4214-831d-30721c26c7fe][sanctification]]. Not because they have lost it but specifically because the aim of history is to the [[id:113d591d-6319-417a-9457-13ad3926c028][Glory of God]], such we understand [[id:60a7181f-eff6-465a-8ffe-306a1b93d86a][redemption]].

We do not believe that the world has moved from good to degraded, then good once more, as if in some [[id:6e7479bb-bd4e-4358-b95d-72f1d675b271][postfallen]] world there has been [[id:8eb98ce7-558a-43a9-8a59-300209b46cac][heaven on earth]] from which we have [[id:e7d61b16-433c-41c5-b329-f06733b43b48][deteriorated]] and that we must now move back to, God makes no partiality to nations now after Christ[fn:1] we cannot claim as the [[id:70336cba-9e67-4971-be8e-12ee42d718b2][Christian Nationalists]] do that God looked favourably on the [[id:6af11c0b-d22b-47c7-9a88-f1424178a8c4][West]], nor more specifically the [[id:4fce0c55-fc3c-4030-b5c1-8e7aa92975ba][Anglosphere]] simply because there was an element of Christian majority. Such would go against the doctrine of [[id:4c0ebe51-3842-44bf-bbb2-6edc29520f77][Original Sin]] and though [[id:d5b0d94e-3c7d-4b38-9103-e6f7eb02914b][Justification]] is punctilliar in its effect, we know and believe that both personal [[id:662101bd-d5e3-4214-831d-30721c26c7fe][Sanctification]] and universal [[id:60a7181f-eff6-465a-8ffe-306a1b93d86a][redemption]] are both progressive in their aim, that is not to say that we can be anything other than [[id:ca432f3b-0792-49f9-9445-2a3bae9763ba][amillennial]], for to believe that [[id:60a7181f-eff6-465a-8ffe-306a1b93d86a][redemption]] can have its end before the [[id:355ff798-8717-4f03-ad45-180400ad3fe2][second coming]] is to fall into the trap of belief in this idea, the possibility of it being in any way redeemed before the culmination.

This idealism comes down to being a problem in their [[id:8a840ac7-5ee6-483a-bd77-ac21be95fcb6][anthropology]], [[id:034c93d0-2eb6-4473-9316-4db87bb1391f][history]], [[id:01b2ea60-b036-4687-abb0-aeed64a80999][Eschatology]], and [[id:60a7181f-eff6-465a-8ffe-306a1b93d86a][theology of redemption]].

* Introspection
Being Self-critical with myself my response to the [[id:fb37c936-58b8-4ebe-8b1a-b7f9e86381c0][Enlightenment]] has in some ways been this form of idealisation drawing on [[id:948869d8-d3bb-4c3e-9aff-43e5a8d4c52c][Christian Primitivism]], the aims of this [[id:4e47ec8f-248b-49ff-a680-9600703a356a][response]] in many ways was to overcome the uncalled for elevation of [[id:0623dc01-9888-426f-a545-7b2b2ecddcc0][rationalism]] that I saw within [[id:1ac4dac1-07eb-4eda-b0f8-2e3d05b47e00][Christianity]] and the [[id:6af11c0b-d22b-47c7-9a88-f1424178a8c4][West]] at the time.
