 - Bullet Journaling is a paper GTD system.
 - There are a few major symbols that I utilise.
   - a simple dot indicates an open task
   - a cross through that dot indicatesa closed task
   - an arrow through that dot indicates a migrated or delegated task
   - a struckthrough task indicates that it is no longer relevant
