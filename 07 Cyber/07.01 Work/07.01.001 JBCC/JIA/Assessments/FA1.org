** Ubuntu -- FA1

:END:
We were provided an Ubuntu installer disc image (ISO file) but it can be
found here:

- [[https://releases.ubuntu.com/24.04.1/ubuntu-24.04.1-desktop-amd64.iso]]

To circumvent VMware's unattended install feature select “I will install
the operating system later.”

[[file:media/image1.png]]

We selected the appropriate settings for the guest operating system and
named it FA1, choosing to store the virtual disk in a single file.

During Install we will utilise the NAT adapter, and subsequently change
to Host-Only

| ISO/Release     | Ubuntu-24.04.1-desktop-amd64.iso        |
|-----------------+-----------------------------------------|
| HDD size        | 25 GB                                   |
| RAM             | 4096 MB                                 |
| CPU cores       | 2                                       |
| Network Adapter | NAT (during install)                    |
|                 |                                         |
|                 | Host-Only (during connectivity testing) |

These settings are in line with the system requirements for Ubuntu found
here:

The Kali install is an imported virtual appliance downloaded from the

* Ubuntu Install
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: ubuntu-install
:END:
The first step of the install given the choices made in setting up the
virtual machine is to add the CD to the VM. Select “Edit virtual machine
settings”

[[file:media/image3.png]]

And add the installation ISO like so.

[[file:media/image4.png]]

Power on the virtual machine and the installer should load up.

[[file:media/image5.png]]

Choose the relevant Language, Accessibility, and Keyboard Layout
selections (the defaults will often suffice)

Connect to the internet via a wired connection.

[[file:media/image6.png]]

- Skip the update for the installer and choose to Install Ubuntu.

- Then choose the Interactive Installation, and default selection of
  apps.

- Don't install proprietary software.

- Choose advanced features and select LVM[fn:1]

- Choose the relevant location details and then hit install.

- Once the install is finished shutdown the guest and remove the ISO
  from its drive.

* Testing connectivity
:PROPERTIES:

- Modify both FA1 and Kali to be on the Host-only network

[[file:media/image9.png]]

- Due to the provisioned hardware of the two virtual machines you should
  be able to run both concurrently

* A1 - Decision of LVM
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: a1---decision-of-lvm
:END:
Logical Volume Manager (LVM) is a pooling management system within Linux
for the grouping of physical disks, while less relevant in a virtualised
environment, due to the extensibility that it provides it is almost
becoming best practice to utilise, as per
https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/lvm-vs-partitioning

[fn:1] This decision is outlined in A1 -- Decision of LVM
