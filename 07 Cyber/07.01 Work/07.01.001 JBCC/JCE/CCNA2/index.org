* Inter-VLAN Routing

* STP Concepts

** Operational State
|
* EtherChannel

* DHCPv4
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol assigns IPv4 addresses and other network configuration information dynamically.
1. DHCP Discover
2. DHCP Offer
3. DHCP Request
4. DHCP Acknowledgement
* SLAAC and DHCPv6
** RA Flags
A = Autoconfiguration flag - Stateless
O = Other configuration flag - Stateless DHCPv6
M = Managed configuration flag - Stateful DHCPv6
** Config

* FHRP Concepts

* LAN Security Concepts

* Switch Security Configuration

* WLAN Concepts

* WLAN Configuration

* Routing Concepts
 - Every router makes its decision alone, based on the information it has in its own routing table.
 - The information in a routing table of one router does not necessarily match the routing table of another router.
 - Routing information about a path does not provide return routing information
* IP Static Routing

* Troubleshoot Static and Default Routes
