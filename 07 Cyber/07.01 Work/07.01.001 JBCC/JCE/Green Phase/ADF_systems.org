* General Principles

Assurance processes, ensuring appropriate protections for official information during processing, storage and communication, are applied to all Information Communications and Technology (ICT) systems and capabilities prior to their operational use.

Regular assessments, performed against emerging cyber threats through the Certification and Accreditation process, ensure associated risks are considered, mitigated, and/or accepted as necessary.

Information Insurance - Measures that protect and defend information and information systems by ensuring the Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability of systems, information and services.
* Certification and Accreditation Process

 - Provides assurance that sufficient security measures are in place or, that deficiencies and their associated risks have been mitigated or accepted.
 - Accreditation of ICT systems provides other Government agencies and coalition partners with confidence that Defence Groups and Services protect shared information and security protected assets.
 - Certification is the process of identifying, assessing and reporting on the risk that an ICT system presents to an information environment.
 - Accreditation is the procedure by which an authoritative body (Accreditation Authority) gives formal recognition, approval and acceptance of the risk(s) to an ICT system.
 - PICTA - Provisional ICT Accreditation (PICTA) is a type of accreditation issued where the Accreditation Authority has requested further controls and/or risk mitigation activities to be undertaken during the provisional accreditation period.
