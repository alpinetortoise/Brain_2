Biometrics are a measurement of certain biological factors to identify a specific person.
Factors are based on parts of the human body that are unique â€“ fingerprints, retina or iris of the eye etc.
Devices should be coupled into security-oriented computer systems that record all access attempts, and should be under surveillance in order to prevent individuals from bypassing them.
Prone to false positives and false negatives.
Biometrics is considered as Personal Identifiable Information (PII). PII is any data that can be used to uniquely identify an individual.
Biometrics can be used in multifactor authentication methods, where it uses two or more processes to login.
