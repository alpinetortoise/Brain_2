* Indicators of Compromise
 - HTTPS traffic over TCP ports 447 or 449 without an associated domain or hostname.
 - HTTP POST requests over standard or non-standard TCP ports for HTTP traffic that end with /81/, /83/ or /90, which are associated with data exfiltration.
 - With Trickbot from Emotet infections, the above HTTP POST requests start with /mor followed by a number (only one or two digits seen so far).
 - HTTP GET requests for URLs that end in .png that return additional Trickbot binaries.
